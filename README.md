# Expense_Tracker
A modern, responsive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check the current weather for any city. The app fetches live data from WeatherAPI, displaying temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with icons. It also handles invalid city inputs gracefully.
